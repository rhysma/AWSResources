# Cloud Migration Strategies
There are six common strategies that an organization can use to migrate its applications to the cloud
 * Rehosting
    * Also called Lift-and-Shift
    * Move legacy applications from on-prem to cloud without changing core architecture, functionality, or performance
    * The goal is to migrate and scale quickly to meet a business use-case  
 * Replatforming
    * Also called Lift-and-Reshape
    * You might make a few cloud optimizations to achieve a tanigible benefit
    * You're not changing the core architecture of the application 
 * Repurchasing
    * Also called Replace-Drop-and-Shop
    * Moving the application or product to a different product on AWS
 * Refactoring
    * Also called Rewriting/Decoupling applications
    * Re-imagining how the application is architected/developed and moving toward those cloud-native features
    * Typically there is a strong business need to add features, scale, performance, etc...That would be otherwise difficult to achieve in the existing environment
 * Retire
    * Deprecate applications that are no longer useful.  
 * Retain
    * Revisit or do nothing (for now) for applications that don't suit any of the above options
