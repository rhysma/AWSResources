# Introduction to AWS Cloud

## What is Cloud Computing?
* the on-demand delivery of IT resources and applications through the Internet, with pay-as-you-go pricing. 
* Stop thinking of your infrastructure as hardware, and instead, think of and use it as software

### Benefits
* You don't have to worry about anticipating your hardware needs ahead of time
* No more ordering, installing, and setting up your data center
* Provision and terminate resources as necessary on AWS
* Don't have to pay for hardware that you don't need when your needs change

## Three Models of Cloud Computing

IaaS ----------- PaaS ----------- SaaS

More control      vs           less control

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
* The most control over configuration
* Control over servers, storage, networking, OS
* The most basic form of cloud IT

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)
* Enables you to run applications without managing underlying infrastructure
* Don't have to worry about hardware/OS

### Software as a Service (SaaS)
* Provides you with a completed product 
* It's run and managed by the service provider


## Unmanaged vs. Managed Services
 * Unmanaged - Scaling, fault tolerance, and availability are managed by you
    * Example: EC2
 * Managed - Scaling, fault tolerance, and availability are managed by the service or are considered built-in
    * Example: S3 

## AWS Foundation Services
The foundation services are what help you run your applications in the cloud. They are grouped into three categories.
* Compute - Services such as EC2 that means you can bring up new server resources quickly
* Networking - Services such as Route 53, VPC, CDN/CloudFront that allow you to be highly available and scalable
* Storage - Services such as EBS. Glacier, S3 that allow you to have options for the type of usage and data

## AWS Platform Services
The platform services allow you to develop and deploy applications in the cloud. They are grouped into six categories.
* Compute - Services such as Elastic Beanstalk, Lambda, ECS, Kubernetes (EKS) that allow you to deploy your application or manage your container environment quickly.
* Databases - RDS, DynamoDB (nosql), ElastiCache, Redshift. These allow you to store data based on the type and usage.
* Analytics - Kinesis, ElasticSearch, CloudSearch. These allow you to monitor and analyze vast amounts of data
* Application integration - Simple Queue Service, Simple Notification Service and tools to help you coordinate your workflow
* Developer tools - CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, CodePipeline that allow you to implement continuous integration and continuous deployment.
* Mobile - Cognito, API Gateway, SMS. The services that allow you to build web and mobile applications
