## Methods of Connecting to AWS

* Three different approaches to interacting with AWS
   * The console - where you log in and view all of the available services, get information on how to use them and tutorials - browser version or mobile application
   * AWS CLI (Command line interface) - Allows you to interact with AWS services through a command-line/terminal system on your computer
   * AWS SDK (Software development kit) - This would allow you to access the AWS resources inside of a custom application, support for multiple languages 
   
## Core Services

### Compute Services

#### Amazon EC2
* [Link to Amazon's documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)
* Different types of instances based on need
   * General, Compute, Memory, Accelerated, and Storage optimized
   * Review the documentation to determine which type is best for your scenario
   * Pricing varies based on the type of instance and size of instance
* Instance Features
   * Burstable Performance - Allows you to choose a baseline level of CPU performance with the ability to burst above the baseline
   * Multiple Storage Options
